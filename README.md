[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/avivajpeyi/lnl_surrogate/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/avivajpeyi/lnl_surrogate?branch=main)

Python package to make a LnL surrogate, given params and lnl as training data (optionally also LnL uncertainty)

This package is more just a wrapper to several other surrogate codes (eg GPs, MLPs, DNNs, etc)
